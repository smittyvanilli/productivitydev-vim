## How this project will help you

This repository is useful since we as developers want to code fast. I have all means necessary to make your experience a productive one using snippets, shorcuts, plugins, and everything to make you one of the fastest developers around.

## How To Get Started

### For Windows Users

To get started, copy the .vimrc file to your username's default folder (i.e. C:$\Documents and Settings$\(user name)$\_vimrc). username is without the parenthesis.

### For Mac Users

To get started, copy the .vimrc file to: /usr/share/vim/vimrc
Make sure the dot is removed from the filename!

### For Linux Users

To get started, copy the .vimrc file to your username account folder (i.e. $/home$/(user name)). User name is without the parenthesis.


## Help

For help, and before you ask, I would search Google for any answers it may provide. This is how I learned many things myself. Otherwise, you could submit an issue and I will get back with an answer. Please be aware, again, I do not know everything! However, I will support this repo in the best way I know.
